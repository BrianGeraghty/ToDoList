This is a website i created while the completing the ASP.Net course in BCIT

It is a simple ToDo list website that allows a user to create a list of tasks for themselves. A user can create and edit their own tasks and view their completed tasks.

There are two user roles, User and Administrator. An administrator can edit other user roles and delete users aswell as create and edit their own tasks.
